# Scales of the Game

The same pattern lives at every level of chess. From one moment of focus to an entire tournament. Once you see it, you see the game differently.

## Seven Scales

```
SCALE 7: THE TOURNAMENT
  Early rounds → Pivotal round → Final rounds
  You control: Preparation. Opening choice. Rest between rounds.

SCALE 6: THE MATCH
  Opening → Middlegame → Endgame
  You control: Which openings to play. When to simplify.

SCALE 5: THE SEQUENCE
  Your plan → The collision → Their plan
  You control: Whether to execute your plan or disrupt theirs.

SCALE 4: THE MOVE
  Candidate moves → Calculation → Chosen move
  You control: How deep you look. How honest you are with yourself.

SCALE 3: THE PIECE
  Where it is → The path → Where it should be
  You control: Piece placement. Coordination.

SCALE 2: THE SQUARE
  Occupied → Contested → Empty
  You control: Which squares you fight for.

SCALE 1: THE ATTENTION
  Focused → Present → Scattered
  You control: Your mind. Your breath. Your presence.
```

## The Pattern

Look at what you can control at each scale:

```
Scale 7 (the tournament):  Almost nothing. Preparation and energy.
Scale 6 (the match):       Some things. Opening choice. Conversion.
Scale 5 (the sequence):    More things. Plans and counter-plans.
Scale 4 (the move):        Real control. Calculation. Honesty.
Scale 3 (the piece):       Direct control. Where things go.
Scale 2 (the square):      Intimate control. What you fight for.
Scale 1 (the attention):   Total control. Whether you're here or not.
```

**Control increases as the scale gets smaller.**

You can't control the tournament pairings. You can't control your opponent's preparation. You can't control whether they find the one move that saves them. But you CAN control your attention. You CAN control whether you're present. You CAN control the pause before you move.

## The Grandmaster's Secret

The grandmaster doesn't win by controlling the tournament. The grandmaster wins by controlling their attention. Everything else cascades from that.

```
Master your attention → master the square.
Master the square → master the piece.
Master the piece → master the move.
Master the move → master the sequence.

It cascades UPWARD.
```

Most teachers start at Scale 5 or 6: study this opening, learn this endgame technique. They skip the foundation. The student can recite the Sicilian Dragon but loses because they stopped paying attention on move 22. They know endgame theory but blunder in time pressure because they never learned to stay present under stress.

## The Same Three at Every Level

Each scale has three parts. Something on one side. Something on the other. And something in the middle that nobody talks about.

| Scale | Side A | The Middle | Side B |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| Tournament | Early rounds | Pivotal round | Final rounds |
| Match | Opening | Middlegame | Endgame |
| Sequence | Your plan | The collision | Their plan |
| Move | Candidates | Calculation | Chosen move |
| Piece | Where it is | The path | Where it should be |
| Square | Occupied | Contested | Empty |
| Attention | Focused | Present | Scattered |

The middle is always where the real chess lives. At EVERY scale. Whether it's the middlegame where theory ends and you begin, or the moment of calculation where you decide between two moves. Same pattern. Different size.

## What This Means

Start at the bottom. Control what you can. Let the rest emerge.

You can't FORCE the tournament to go your way. You CAN be fully present on every move. You CAN give your complete attention to this position, right now. The big games take care of themselves when the small moments are mastered.

That's not a chess metaphor. That's how everything works.
