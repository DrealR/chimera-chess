# Focus and Attention

The biggest difference between a 1200 and a 2000 isn't knowledge. It's attention. The 1200 knows most of the same patterns. They just stop paying attention on move 22.

## Where Your Games Are Actually Lost

Replay your last ten losses. Most of them won't be brilliant attacks by your opponent. They'll be moments where you stopped looking. You were winning. You relaxed. You played a move without checking. You missed the one thing that was obvious in hindsight.

```
THE 1200 LOSS:
  Good opening. Reasonable middlegame.
  Move 25: opponent plays a simple tactic.
  You didn't see it. Not because it was hard.
  Because you weren't looking anymore.

THE GRANDMASTER LOSS:
  Deep preparation. Sharp middlegame.
  Move 40: opponent finds a resource in a position
  that looked dead. A move that required 15 minutes
  of calculation to find.
  That's a real loss. Yours probably wasn't.
```

Most games below master level are decided by attention, not knowledge.

## What You Actually Control

You can't control your opponent's preparation. You can't control the pairings. You can't control whether they find the one saving move in a lost position. You can't control your rating.

What you control:

```
YOUR ATTENTION:
  Are you looking at the whole board or just your attack?
  Did you check what THEY want to do before you moved?
  Are you here, or are you thinking about the last game?

YOUR TIME MANAGEMENT:
  Are you spending time on the moves that matter?
  Capablanca moved instantly in positions he understood
  and spent twenty minutes on the critical moment.
  Most amateurs spend the same time on every move.

YOUR HONESTY:
  When you see a move you like, do you look for
  the reason it DOESN'T work? Or do you play it
  because you want it to work?
  Calculation isn't about finding good moves.
  It's about being honest with yourself about
  whether they actually work.
```

## The Blunder Check

Before every move, ask one question: what does my opponent do after this?

Not "what's my plan." What's THEIR response. One question. Two seconds. It catches 80% of blunders before they happen.

```
WITHOUT THE CHECK:
  "I'll put my bishop here. Looks good. Nice diagonal."
  Opponent plays knight fork. Wins the bishop.
  You saw the diagonal. You didn't see their knight.

WITH THE CHECK:
  "I'll put my bishop here. Wait — what do they do?"
  You see the knight fork.
  You put the bishop somewhere else.
  Game continues.
```

This isn't advanced chess. This is the single habit that separates improving players from stuck players. Two seconds. Every move. What do they do after this?

## Concentration is a Muscle

You don't start a tournament being able to focus for five hours. You build it.

Play one slow game a week where you check every move for opponent responses. Just one. The rest of the week, play blitz, have fun. But that one slow game is your gym session for concentration.

After a month, the checking becomes automatic. After six months, you're catching things you used to miss without even trying. The pattern-recognition didn't change. Your attention did.

Most chess improvement below 2000 is attention improvement, not chess improvement.

*The board doesn't change between a blunder and a brilliant move. Your attention does.*
