# Levels of the Game

The game looks different depending on how close you zoom in. From a single moment of focus to an entire tournament, the same question keeps showing up: what can you actually control?

## Seven Levels

```
THE TOURNAMENT
  Round after round. Managing energy.
  You control: Preparation. Opening choice. Rest between rounds.

THE GAME
  Opening → Middlegame → Endgame.
  You control: Which openings to play. When to simplify.

THE SEQUENCE
  Your plan collides with theirs.
  You control: Whether to execute your plan or disrupt theirs.

THE MOVE
  Candidates → Calculation → Decision.
  You control: How deep you look. How honest you are with yourself.

THE PIECE
  Where it is → Where it should be.
  You control: Piece placement. Coordination.

THE SQUARE
  Occupied → Contested → Empty.
  You control: Which squares you fight for.

THE FOCUS
  Are you here or somewhere else?
  You control: Your attention. Your presence at the board.
```

## The Pattern

The closer you zoom in, the more control you have.

```
The tournament:    Almost nothing. Preparation and energy.
The game:          Some things. Opening choice. Conversion.
The sequence:      More things. Plans and counter-plans.
The move:          Real control. Calculation. Honesty.
The piece:         Direct control. Where things go.
The square:        Intimate control. What you fight for.
The focus:         Total control. Whether you're here or not.
```

You can't control the tournament pairings. You can't control your opponent's preparation. You can't control whether they find the one move that saves them. But you CAN control your attention. You CAN control whether you're present. You CAN control the pause before you move.

## The Grandmaster's Secret

The grandmaster doesn't win by controlling the tournament. The grandmaster wins by controlling their attention. Everything else cascades from that.

```
Master your focus → master the square.
Master the square → master the piece.
Master the piece → master the move.
Master the move → master the sequence.

It cascades UPWARD.
```

Most teachers start at the game level: study this opening, learn this endgame technique. They skip the foundation. The student can recite the Sicilian Dragon but loses because they stopped paying attention on move 22. They know endgame theory but blunder in time pressure because they never learned to stay present under stress.

## Zoom Levels

| Level | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| Tournament | Early rounds → Pivotal round → Final rounds |
| Game | Opening → Middlegame → Endgame |
| Sequence | Your plan → The collision → Their plan |
| Move | Candidates → Calculation → Chosen move |
| Piece | Where it is → The path → Where it should be |
| Square | Occupied → Contested → Empty |
| Focus | Present → Reading → Deciding |

The transitions between levels matter as much as the levels themselves. The middlegame moment where theory runs out and you're on your own. The half-second of calculation where you choose between two candidate moves. Same idea, different zoom.

*Start with your focus. Control what you can. Let the rest follow.*
