# CHIMERA Chess

## Project Context

All project context, curriculum data, and philosophy docs live in the repo root:

- `seed/` — founding principle ("everything is connected")
- `core/` — 7 core concepts (focus, sacrifice, whole-board vision, tempo, tension, the pawn, three phases)
- `deep/` — 7 advanced explorations (forks, zugzwang, blitz vs classical, the queen, endgame, castling, attention warfare)

**Read these before building any feature.** They define the language, metaphors, and teaching philosophy.

## Key Concepts for Development

- **Your army is ONE creature** — pieces are organs, not individuals
- **Influence = breathing** — how much of the board can a side reach
- **Two Hurricanes** — each king is the eye of a storm, center is the collision zone
- **The Cheat Code** — LOOK, THINK, CHECK, MOVE, RESET (pre-move protocol)
- **8 Nature Superpowers** — biological patterns mapped to chess and CS concepts

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- Vitest for tests
- Deployed on Vercel

## Breath Protocol

1. Pull before starting (inhale)
2. Work (expand/compress)
3. Commit + push when done (exhale)
4. One agent at a time — the commit is the heartbeat
