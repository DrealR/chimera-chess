# The Fork

One piece. Two targets. The opponent can only save one.

That's a fork. It's the simplest tactic in chess. It's also the deepest.

## How a Fork Works

```
BEFORE THE FORK:
  Your knight is on a quiet square.
  Their queen is on one side.
  Their rook is on the other.
  Nothing is happening.

AFTER THE FORK:
  Your knight jumps to the square BETWEEN them.
  Now it attacks both.
  They can save the queen or the rook. Not both.
  You win the rook.
```

The power isn't in either target. It's in the square your knight occupies — the one in the MIDDLE, threatening both sides. That square is where the magic happens. Not the queen's square. Not the rook's square. The BETWEEN square.

## Why Tactics Work

A fork is one piece creating two problems. But every tactic shares something with that idea — they all work by giving the opponent more problems than they can handle in one move.

```
FORK:      One piece attacks two pieces.
PIN:       One piece paralyzes another (can't move without exposing what's behind).
SKEWER:    One piece forces a choice (move the front piece, lose the back).
DISCOVERY: One move reveals a second attack (the piece that moved + the piece behind it).
```

A pin isn't a fork. A skewer isn't a fork. They're different patterns with different setups and different defenses. But they all exploit the same thing: your opponent only gets one move per turn. Create two threats, and one of them gets through.

## Pattern Recognition

Beginners calculate forks. They look at every possible knight move and check whether it attacks two pieces. This takes forever and usually misses the fork anyway.

Masters SEE forks. They don't calculate — they recognize. The pattern is in their unconscious. When the queen and king are on the same diagonal, a bishop fork is possible. When two pieces are a knight's jump apart, the alarm goes off automatically.

```
BEGINNER:
  Sees the position.
  Looks for moves. One by one.
  Checks each one for tactics.
  Maybe finds the fork. Maybe doesn't.
  Takes 5 minutes.

MASTER:
  Sees the position.
  The fork is OBVIOUS.
  Like seeing a face in a crowd.
  Not calculated. RECOGNIZED.
  Takes 2 seconds.
```

This is what ten thousand hours looks like. Not better calculation. Better SEEING. The patterns you've absorbed become part of how you look at the board. You don't find forks. Forks find you.

## The Setup

Forks don't happen randomly. The master CREATES the conditions. Three moves before the fork, they're maneuvering. Placing pieces on specific squares. Trading one piece to open a line. Pushing a pawn to create a weakness. Then — fork. It looks sudden. It was planned.

```
LUCKY FORK:
  The opponent blundered.
  Their pieces happened to be on the wrong squares.
  You saw it. Good eyes.

CREATED FORK:
  You pushed their pieces to the wrong squares.
  You set the trap three moves ago.
  They walked in because they didn't see what you were building.
  That's not luck. That's vision.
```

*One piece. Two targets. One move. The power is in the space between the targets — the square that threatens everything at once.*
