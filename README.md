Start with `seed/` — one document, one idea.
Then `core/` — the principles at work.
Then `deep/` — where it gets specific.

---

```
seed/   everything is connected
core/   three phases, tempo, tension, sacrifice,
        seeing the whole board, focus, the pawn
deep/   the fork, zugzwang, blitz vs classical,
        the queen, the endgame, castling
```
